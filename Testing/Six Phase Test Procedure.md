#Six Phase Test Procedure

##Phase 1:  Flat test coupons subjected to various testing procedures

* tensile test (cryo & ambient)

* thermal cycling test (looking for delamination etc after 10 cycles)

* running comparison between both procedures

* pass/fail criteria 

	* Factor of safety:  2:1

##Phase 2:  Creating physical layups/prototypes

* will all these layers actually fit together & interface without failure

* Endcap with fitting for inlet for hydrotesting (phase 3)

##Phase 3:  Hydrotest tank

* figure out the fitting which will interface with endcap and hydropump

* Determining burst pressure

* -Identifying leakage

		 

##Phase 4:  Cryo fill cycle

* fill with liquid nitrogen, let it return to ambient temp

* repeat.  Similar testing procedure to phase 1 with coupons

##Phase 5:  Additional hydro test, after cryo-hydro testing.

* Comparison run to see how cryo filling has altered various factors, if at all

##Phase 6: Cryo fill tank with pressure release valve connected

* see how long it takes for the tank to drain (% mass loss over time)
