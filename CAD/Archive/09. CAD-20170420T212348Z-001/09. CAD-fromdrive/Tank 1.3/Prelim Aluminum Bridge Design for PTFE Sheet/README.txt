The assembly with PTFE snap looks wonky because I did not alter the Main Ring design that Russell has modeled, his model still includes
the offset portion for the lapping of the PTFE, whereas this bridge design would be more along the lines of the Airframe ring design
with no offest portion, but it is partially representative of what it would look like with wrapped PTFE adhered to the bridge.
Again, preliminary work and we can tweak as necessary if we want to move forward with it.
