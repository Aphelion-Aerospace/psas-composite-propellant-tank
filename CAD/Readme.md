## Model Naming Conventions
Current working models should be located in the Current Folder.  Once adjustments have been made, please move previous
models/designs into the appropriate Archive.

~NB

CAD Model Naming Convention:

Part numbering convention:
####-A (first two digits are type of part, i.e. rings or end cap...etc, last two digits are iteration #)
Liner: 01 series          Example: 0101 is first liner iteration, 0102 is second liner iteration
Rings: 02 series
End cap: 03 series
Al Tape: 04 series
PRV pipe: 05
Gasket: 06
Letters refer to various versions, such as tube liner vs sheet with seam liner
Example: 0201-A is ring designed for sheet liner iteration 1, 0201-B is ring designed for tube liner iteration 2.

A=Sheet liner, B=Tube liner


## Summary of Iterations so far:

- Tank Iteration 1: (Archive/First Tank Assembly) This is a design with a round end cap. 

- Tank Iteration 2: (Archive/Second_model) Has a flat end cap, screw size is 0-80.

- Tank Iteration 3: (current/Flat End Cap Model (.031-in Sheet Liner)) This model uses the thin PTFE sheet that is etched
on one side for bonding. Screws have been updated to size 3-48. The assembly has two options for end caps. There is a flat
end cap and a bell shaped end cap. The flat endcap requires nuts and washers to attach the threaded fittings. The bell shaped
end cap has threading to attach the fittings. Note: to view the bell shaped endcap suppress End Cap<1> and End Cap <2> and unsuppress 
Alternative End Cap and No Holes End Cap. This design requires an aluminum bridge (not shown) to bond the sheet in a tube shape.

- Tank Iteration 4: (current\Flat End Cap Model (0.125-in Tube Liner)) This model uses an 1/8^th inch tube of PTFE and has a flat endcap

- Tank Iteration 5: (current\Shrink Fit Model (0.125-in Tube Liner)) End cap was modified for a shrink fit design. The sizing for the fitting
portion will be complete when the size calculations are done. We are also considering adding a keyway for hole alignment.
