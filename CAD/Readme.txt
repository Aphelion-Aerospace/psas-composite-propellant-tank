CAD Model Naming Convention:

Part numbering convention:
####-A (first two digits are type of part, i.e. rings or end cap...etc, last two digits are iteration #)
Liner: 01 series          Example: 0101 is first liner iteration, 0102 is second liner iteration
Rings: 02 series
End cap: 03 series
Al Tape: 04 series
PRV pipe: 05
Gasket: 06
Letters refer to various versions, such as tube liner vs sheet with seam liner
Example: 0201-A is ring designed for sheet liner iteration 1, 0201-B is ring designed for tube liner iteration 2.

A=Sheet liner, B=Tube liner
