Now that we have money let’s stop working on getting deals let’s just buy stuff.

Each subgroup should identify the tasks that will take the longest

**Engine**

Working on making changes for more manufacturable parts

**Github**

Create open issues and make tags so that we can see what need to be done and keep track of it getting done

We can check any repo within the PSAS org and see what things they need done and maybe do them

Make sure to close finished issues

We should check the airframe LV3.0 airframe

**They need to hydro test the tanks that they have (perhaps we can assist with that)**
