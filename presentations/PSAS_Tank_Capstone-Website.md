## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a design and a manufacturing process for a composite fuel tank intended to hold liquid oxygen propellant for use in the Portland State Aerospace Society's LV4 rocket.

## Customer/Market Requirements

PSAS requires a composite fuel tank that ...

- is liquid oxygen (LOX) safe for duration of fill cycle and launch.
- does not fail when pressurized to 6 ATM.
- wonâ€™t fail at expected scaled LV4 flight loadings (meets Factor of Safety =2) for combined loads of thermal and propellant stresses.
- has a manufacturing process which can be performed in the ME department machine shop, or outsourced for a reasonable fee (< $500).


## Design Challenges

The team's primary design challenge is isolating the LOX fuel from reactive materials, such as the Structural Carbon Fiber layers, and maintaining a seal at room-temperatures, as well as at cryogenic, operational temperatures.

## Outcomes

The team has developed a conceptual design that
