Hi all!

I reorganized the group drive -adding folders, removing redundancies, and generally labeling things so we know where and what things are. I noticed a number of duplicate folders that suggest that we don't have an explicit labeling and organizing scheme, so I created one. In the drive folder you will find things have been organized more-or-less hierarchically. For each major folder, I added a description (which can be found in the details section, just press the i button) that designates what should go in it and how files and subfolders should be labeled. I would appreciate it if everyone read through the descriptions of ALL the main folders so that we can standardize our documentation method, and so you all know where to find everything, now that I've moved things around!

I would also like to call attention to a couple of things:

1. Most dating has been standardized to the international method YYYY\_MM\_DD and it would be great if that could be maintained throughout our documentation.

2. As we produce more design iterations, it would be helpful to designate version names so that files in the Design, CAD, and FEA folders can be easily associated (I have started with 1.0 and labeled the flat-end caps part of version 1.2)

3. There are two documents that I think should be frequently updated and checked by all team members to make sure we are all on the same page, documentation doesn't get forgotten, and to facilitate work distribution:

A. TESTING &gt; TEST COUPONS AND RESULTS

For every coupon that is created, or needs to be created, assign it a coupon number and a description. Follow up with which test it is to be used for and if it has been tested. If a Test folder doesn't exist for the desired test, create it. This should ideally be done before the coupons are even tested. It would be great if this could be considered an up-to-date document charting all tests and current coupons available for testing. People could even list coupons they would like to have made, to be assigned an id at a later date.

B. RESOURCE DOCUMENTS &gt; OUTSIDE CONTACTS

I created this document from the content of the 'contacts' document, which shall be reserved for in-house contacts from now on.

All manufacturers/suppliers/etc. can now be found in this document. There are still a lot of holes, so feel free to fill in what you know. This is meant to be an up-to-date representation of our relationships and quote statuses. It includes such sections as 'team contact' - whomever has been the primary contact for a given company, and most likely the most knowledgeable. There is also a 'last-contacted' and 'outstanding quotes' section, so that people can see who needs to be contacted and for what. Also, there is a 'history' section, to describe what we have recieved/ know about the company. If this document is kept up-to-date, it could effectively be used to delegate reachout tasks.

Once quotes are received, that should be reflected in this document. The actual quotes are to be kept in the 'Materials' or 'Manufacturing' folder, depending on relevance. Once something is chosen for purchase, copy quote to ‘Finances & Ordering’ folder.
