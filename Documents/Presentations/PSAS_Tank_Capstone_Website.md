## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a design and a manufacturing process for a composite fuel tank intended to hold liquid oxygen propellant for use in the Portland State Aerospace Society's LV4 rocket.

## Customer/Market Requirements

PSAS requires a composite fuel tank that ...

- is liquid oxygen (LOX) safe for duration of fill cycle and launch.
- does not fail when pressurized to 6 ATM.
- wonâ€™t fail at expected scaled LV4 flight loadings (meets Factor of Safety =2) for combined loads of thermal and propellant stresses.
- has a manufacturing process which can be performed in the ME department machine shop, or outsourced for a reasonable fee (<$500 per component, assuming 1-3 outsourced components).


## Design Challenges

The team's primary design challenges are isolating the LOX fuel from reactive materials, such as the structural Carbon Fiber layers, and maintaining a seal at room-temperature, as well as at cryogenic, operational temperatures.

## Outcomes

The team has developed a tank design that takes the current PSAS airframe design and incorporates a LOX-compatable PTFE liner to chemically insulate the tank from LOX and shrink-fit aluminum end-caps to mechanically seal the LOX off from the rest of the airframe structure at room and cryogenic temperatures.

Testing is currently underway to ascertain the material properties of the PTFE, in order to create a more accurate FEA model of the tank and allow for optimization of design geometry.
