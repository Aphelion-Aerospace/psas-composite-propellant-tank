## Rough Calculations for Approximating Time to Thermal Equilibrium for PTFE Test Rings in Liquid Nitrogen:

### Known Values:
c = 970 W/kgC  (*PTFE specific heat Capacity Coefficient from EngineeringToolbox.com*)

k = 0.25 W/mK  (*PTFE Thermal Conductivity Coefficient at 25C from EngineeringToolbox.com*)

m = 0.076 kg  (*Mass of Ring*)

A = 0.005m^2 (*Surface Area of Ring*)

d = 0.005 m (*Thickness of Ring*)

$\delta$ T = 215C (*Change in Temperature, from Room to Cryo-temp*)


### Total Heat Transfered:
Q = mcdT

Q = 15849.8 Joules

### Heat Transfer Rate:
q = kA*dT /d
q = 53.75 W

### Time to Thermal Equilibrium:

T = Q/q

Time = 294.88s = **4.94 minutes**

## Conclusion:

PTFE Rings will be submerged for a minimum of **6** minutes during Liquid Nitrogen Testing, to ensure they reach maximum cryo temperature before measurement.
