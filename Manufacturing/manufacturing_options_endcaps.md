What are the manufacturing options for the tank end cap?

***Machining with CNC mill***

**Manufacturing videos**

-   3 axis milling for the outer part of the dome: [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh9xZiqeF04*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh9xZiqeF04)

-   5 axis milling for the inner part of the dome: [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUoIzkCSpag*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUoIzkCSpag)

**Pros**

-   No machine/labor cost to machine the part in-house (if the part only requires a 3-axis CNC mill).

-   Lower lead time.

-   Reproducible for future PSAS teams.

**Cons**

-   More material relative to other manufacturing processes.

-   The end-product might be thicker, heavier.

**Questions**

-   How do we fix a round part so we can machine both sides of the dome?

**Potential Vendors**

***Hydroforming***

**Manufacturing videos**

-   [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-ht\_5Ysurc*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-ht_5Ysurc)

**Pros**

-   Amalco will give parts for free if you want a small number of units (you must pay for set up)

-   Less expensive than other metal forming methods, such as deep drawing when producing small quantities.

-   Dome cross section is thinner.

-   Can scale up to larger diameters.

**Cons**

-   Potentially long lead time.

-   Cost for set-up fee.

**Questions**

-   Do they have standard sizes that fit our needs?

-   Can we machine threaded holes in the part?

-   How does this constrain the geometry of the part?
