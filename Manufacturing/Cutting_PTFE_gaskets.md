# PTFE gasket Cutting

To determine if we can cut PTFE gaskets on a laser cutter a few things needed to be done.

*  Check for safety
*  Get permission from Mike to cut a material not listed in the acceptable materials list for the laser cutter
*  Determine if the material will cut well



## Safety 
The MSDS shows that it has no flash point. It also states to ensure good ventilation if there is  the possibility of fumes. When laser cutting there will be fumes. The Laser cutter in 480 has ample ventilation.
## Get Permission
When I talked to Mike at first he said no, I then explained what I wanted to do. Because the material that we will be cutting is very thin he agreed to let us cut the gaskets with the laser.
##  Determining Power and speed of the laser
To ensure a good cut is made I made a few test cuts on the PTFE gasket material. The geometry of these test cuts were circles the size of the clearance holes. I first started with a medium power with a high speed. This cut failed to cut all the way through the material with one pass. I then slowed down the speed of the laser head to 10% and the cut was smooth with no visible discolorations of the material. The holes were cut in the far corner of the material to reduce any wasted material. The holes were also visibly perfect.

### Notes for cutting PTFE gasket
Follow Melts guidelines on their website for using the laser cutter. When it come time to select what material you are cutting there is not PTFE setting. There is a tab for custom settings. currently I recommend 50% power and 10% speed.
