Courtesy of John & Ian for meeting with us:

webplotdigitizer (google search)
	-converts snap of stress/strain curve to data points to be able to reference (neat tool)
	-set axis', create points, pull data as CSV

swiftcomp (for delamination etc)

	-set up excel doc to keep track of everything with different tabs (similar to John's formatting)

	-for plasticity model, abaqus doesnt care about linear elastic region
		-after webplotdigitizer, go to pt where yield is, compute new modulus(have cell @ yield point where you
		(divide stress by strain) this is general yield str (ex Al ~ 79Gpa)
		-true strain -(true stress/new modulus @ yield) if you do it right, it should end up being 0 @ yield point
		-this is now plasticity model for abaqus
		-can then change up the plot to represent this plastic model
			-this is what abaqus cares about, especially the last point
		-gz you just created a true plastic strain model

Roadmap for modeling:
	Model 1:
	-Model solid Al tank
		-linear elastic model (highest stress, forces, problem areas)
		-plasticity model (check behavior, checking for equiv plastic strain (equiv von mises basically))
			(checking to see where plastic strain is starting
		-Failure analysis: here we start to lose ability to use symmetry in the model
			(consider: non-linear materials?  Geometric non-linearity?(based on plasticity model), if this is present,
			cannot use symmetry, must use whole model)
		-If things are working out well so far, Static/dynamic explicit solution(wrt time) (impact, contact, ht xfer, fluids etc)
			-Once here no more symmetry possible, must do full model
	Model 2:
		-Full model (real thing, w/ all materials etc)
			-Run through same steps above, Plasticity model, temp model
	
In Abaqus (quick modeling ex)
	-for ex w/ John
		-3d (geometry type), deformable, shell
			-Abaqus does not recognize cylindrical coords.  This needs to be added, and then setting checked in order
				to relate the results to a cylindrical coord system (Z,R,theta)
		-Create Datum CSYS: cylindrical 
			-just put it right in the center(though it puts theta in the wrong direction)
		-Massage method:  create datum points (one on each edge, so one is right in the middle)
			-create datum offset from a point: Query->tools to find location of offset point on edge first, 
				then can enter coords for Z.  This will create an offset point to be able to access the theta-R plane
		-Select center data point to be origin, point on R plane, then offset for theta
		
	-material properties:
		-mechanical:elasticity, poissons (type isotropic)(for linear elastic)
		-Mechanical:plasticity(going to have to research this to determine what time of analysis to use)
				-Yield stress:plastic strain (from the excel sheet we generated earlier)
		-Hardening drop down: start w/ isotropic

	-create section:shell, homogenous
		-thickness:(actual thickness)
	-assign sectuion
		-shell offset: middle surface
	-assembly,instance
		-any additional datums or work from here to under assembly dropddown
	-steps, intial (linear elastic step is initial):static general, general procedure type
	-loads/bcs
	-meshing:elem type(standard, linear, shell, start with reduced integration since it saves time)
	-mesh controls:up to us (for now quad medial axis since its a cylinder)

	-Run linear static job
		
	-for linear plastic: (STEPS MUST BE IN ORDER)
			steps->new step(plastic)->procedure type:general->static,general->window pops up:
			->Nlgeom:stick with off for now, but if we need it turn on.
			->incrementation:increment size:(initial to maximum represents load) for # of increments(ex 100), w/
				intial @ .01 max @0.5, .01 will be the increment (for convergence)  if it does not converge,
				it will up the increment, to a maximum of .5 in order to reach convergence. (this still a little unclear)
	-Foutput: timing:output at exact times:0.1(ex)

	-plastic job: Pull up monitor when running jobs(GREAT TOOL so you can see what's going on(steps, increments etc...))
		-Results:result options, transformation, transformation type, user specified, click the global cyl coords you saved
			(this was to convert back to cyl coord system mentioned earlier)
		-through step increments, should see no plastic deformation(0's) in linear steps/results
