    "Assuming that the materials are bonded at the interfaces, have isotropic properties, and that their change in thickness is negligible compared to change in their circumferences, the strain equations can be equated to each other at the interfaces. Substituting known values and solving the systems of equations reveals the pressure at each interface. These values can then be substituted back into Eq. 4, and both sides multiplied by the elastic modulus. The maximum stress in a cylindrical pressure vessel occurs at the innermost fiber, so the maximum stress in each layer is then found by:\n",
