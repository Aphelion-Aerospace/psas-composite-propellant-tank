    "# Analysis of Sealing Potential of Liner Captured Between Aluminum Rings Via Shrink Fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Objective: \n",
    "Determine how much pressure will be placed on the liner at both room and cryogenic temperatures, based on the aluminum outer ring's inner diameter, an aluminum end cap's outer diameter, and the thickness of the PTFE liner. Compare this to the strength of the PTFE material at each of these temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Second Objective:\n",
    "If the liner compression is at or exceeds the load necessary to seal the tank, determine the shrink fit pressure at the aluminum interface that can be achieved while maintaining this liner pressure.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Since little theory has been found governing the sealing potential of radially loaded gaskets in the shape of an annulus, we take the approach that we can break down the elements of the ASME pressure vessel code equations and apply them to our geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The PTFE's strength is not sufficient to prevent the shrunken aluminum from returning to its original room temperature size, or deform either of the aluminum parts. In other words, the aluminum parts are rigid bodies moving relative to the PTFE as they expand or contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The interface of the aluminum parts is at the inner diameter of the outer aluminum ring, regardless of intereference thickness. ($R = D_{i,ring}/2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stress concentrations in the liner that occur at the ends of the aluminum parts can be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The internal pressure of the vessel will have a negligible effect on the portion of the liner that is compressed between shrink-fitted aluminum parts.\n",

    "## ASME Pressure Vessel Code Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "This code was developed for flat gaskets compressed between flanges. There are two equations, both give a value for the total bolt force needed to compress a gasket such that a seal is achieved at working pressure. Whichever equation gives a greater load for a specific design application is the one to be used. The following are the equations as they appear in _Gaskets. Design, Selection, and Testing_ by Daniel E. Czernik:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W_{m_2} = \\pi bGy$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$W_{m_1} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}G^2P + 2\\pi bGmP$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $W_{m_1}$ and $W_{m_2}$ are total bolt loads in pounds, $b$ is the effective gasket contact seating width in inches, $G$ is the mean diameter of the gasket contact face in inches, $y$ is the gasket contact surface unit seating load in pounds per square inch, $m$ is a dimensionless gasket factor, and $P$ is the maximum working internal pressure of the vessel.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a typical round gasket, the effective gasket contact seating width is the difference between the outer and inner radii, or $r_o - r_i$. The mean diameter of such a gasket is simply the sum of the inner and outer radii, or $r_o + r_i$. When multiplied together, the product is the difference of the squares of the radii: $(r_o - r_i)(r_o + r_i) = (r_o^2 - r_i^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the conslusion that $\\pi bG = \\pi (r_o^2 - r_i^2)$ is simply the area of one side of the gasket. This means that the $y$ is the only part of the first equation that we need for our analysis. We need at least enough pressure from the shrink fit to reach the seating load.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second equation, the first term is simply the prodcut of the internal working pressure and the cross sectional area normal to the central axis of the tank. In other words, this is the bolt load needed to prevent the ends from losing contact with the rest of the tank. Since we are loading the liner in the radial direction, we can also remove this term from our analysis of the liner as a gasket. The second term is similar to the first equation, but has a factor of two to account for both surfaces of the gasket that provide paths for escaping fluid, and $y$ is replaced with $mP$. Values for $m$ and $y$ appear to be imperically determined for different materials of varied thicknesses, and are found in tables provided by the ASME or material manufacturer. Dupont's PTFE Handbook lists PTFE as having a gasket factor, $m$, of 2.00 and a seating load, $y$, of 1200 psi for a 1/8\" gasket. Because there will only be a fluid path on one side of the liner, we assume the factor of two can be removed.  \n",
